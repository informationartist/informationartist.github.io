Welcome to my page!


# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Ruchi, the brain behind Information Artist.

I help change-makers, tech leaders, and teams bring clarity, creativity, and calm to complexity.

Through coaching, thought-leadership, and actionable strategies I empower professionals to design better ways of working, leading, and learning. If you're building change, scaling delivery, or nurturing people-first performance, you're in the right place.
