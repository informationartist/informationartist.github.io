Welcome to my page!


# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ruchi, founder of the Information Artist.

I help change-makers, tech leaders, and teams bring clarity, creativity, and calm to complexity.

Through coaching, toolkits, and thought-provoking content, I empower professionals to design better ways of working, leading, and learning. If you're building change, scaling delivery, or nurturing people-first performance, you're in the right place.
